    [`bug 1616105 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystoneauth/+bug/1616105>`_]
    Only log the response body when the ``Content-Type`` header is set to
    ``application/json`` or ``application/text``. This avoids logging large
    binary objects (such as images). Other ``Content-Type`` will not be
    logged.
